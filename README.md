# Intrusion_detection

With the increase of computer and network systems, security issues have emerged at an alarming rate. Computer users generally become the victim of attackers directly or indirectly, and most of the time they are unaware of their data breaching. Hence, an intrusion detection technique is required. On the other hand, in the current era, there are lots of intrusion categories available. So, to generate an acceptable intrusion detection technique, we consider different types of intrusions. Hence, I identified common types of intrusion; namely Denial of Service (DoS), normal, Probing Attack (Probe),	User to Root Attack (U2R), Remote to Local Attack (R2L). Secondly, I collected a dataset where all these intrusion categories are common. Afterward, I apply a text clean-up process to remove the noisy data. Later, I selected six different machine learning approaches such as Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to detect intrusion. Finally, I compared the accuracy among all six machine learning techniques. In the experiment, Random Forest and ANN outperformed others. Besides, I also recorded the time complexity for each algorithm.
